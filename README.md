College Event Management System (MERN)

This is a beginner-level College Event Management System built using the MERN stack. The project will have two roles: Student and Event Head. Event Heads will manage events and Students will view and register for events.

Current Status

Backend Setup: Connected the project to MongoDB using Mongoose and started building backend APIs, including routes and controllers for managing events.

User Authentication: Implemented user signup and login functionality using JWT authentication, where passwords are securely stored in hashed format and a token is generated after successful login.

Frontend & API Integration: Created basic UI components like the Home page and Navbar, and connected the frontend with backend APIs to fetch event data and handle user login/signup.
