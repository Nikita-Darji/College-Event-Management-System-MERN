College Event Management System (MERN)

This is a beginner-level College Event Management System built using the MERN stack. The project will have two roles: Student and Event Head. Event Head will manage events and Students will view and register for events.

--Student registration API created and linked with events using eventId reference

--Registration data successfully stored with event reference passed via route parameters

✅ Authentication & Authorization
